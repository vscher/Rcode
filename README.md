This set of scripts can be used to replicate the time series analysis of the proportion of stocked hydroelectric energy (ONS2016) in South of Brazil (Section 6). The main file is Application.r. This is the file that contains the instructions to be executed. 

Some R packages are required. If they are not installed, you must run the following commands:
install.packages("gdata")
install.packages("e1071")
install.packages("forecast")

If you have questions regarding the computer code, please contact Vin√≠cius Scher at vinitscher at gmail [dot] com.
